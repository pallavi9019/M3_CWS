# Requirements
## Introduction
Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller and driver IC to drive the wiper motor. Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller.
## Research
  CAR WIPING SYSTEM
  
The source code is to be compiled in STMcubeIDED. This CAR WIPING SYSTEM in EMBEDDED C is not designed to run on the Turbo C versions. The source code for this mini project is around 1000 lines, so I didn’t want to display it here.

## Cost and Features
Our CAR WIPING SAYSTEM put learning. Your knowledge will be tested regarding a variety of objects. 


## Defining Our System
* According to WHO, more than 1.25 million people die every year because of road crashes and mostly in rainy seasons. People end up dying because of small mistakes. Here we have forwarded an attempt to reduce that number. The project is especially suited for car.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

* All the mind people like students,children engineers for work,fun and projects.

## What:

* project, a number of objects are placed, and the user is will get automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops.

## When:

* During the step-In training, this is the final project assessment and development started on 20th of march.

## Where:

* This can be used in all over the globe. any student/working professional of any age can use it.

## How:

* users can use this code to easy their work and project.
