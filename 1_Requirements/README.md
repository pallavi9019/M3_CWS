## Introduction
Today’s car wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller and driver IC to drive the wiper motor. Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller.
## Research
  DISTANCE FINDER...
  
The source code is to be compiled in VS CODE with AVR compiler. This DISTANCE FINDER in EMBEDDED C is not designed to run on the Turbo C versions. The source code for this mini project is around 1000 lines, so I didn’t want to display it here.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cost and Features
Our DISTANCEFINDER put learning. Your knowledge will be tested regarding a variety of objects. 


## Defining Our System
* ATmega32 microcontroller needs to transmit at least 10 us trigger pulse to the HC-SR04 Trig Pin.
After getting a trigger pulse, HC-SR04 automatically sends eight 40 kHz sound waves and the microcontroller waits for rising edge output at the Echo pin.
When the rising edge capture occurs at the Echo pin which is connected to an input of ATmega16, start Timer of ATmega16 and again wait for a falling edge on the Echo pin.
As soon as the falling edge is captured at the Echo pin, the microcontroller reads the count of the Timer. This time count is used to calculate the distance to an object

## Introduction
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor to indicate the distance of any object from it. Here we have made a setup based on a microcontroller in which real time distance is sensed by an ultrasonic sensor and displays measured distance on an LCD display.
